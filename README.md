# Project: AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Purpose:
To create a production-quality, AI-native technical textbook that teaches Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems, and deploy it as an interactive learning platform with an embedded RAG chatbot.

## Target Audience:
- University-level students
- Robotics and AI beginners
- Engineers transitioning into robotics
- Self-learners with Python and basic AI knowledge

## Core Principles:
- Technical accuracy over assumptions
- Clarity for beginners without oversimplifying
- Practical, hands-on learning orientation
- Simulation-first before real hardware
- Ethical and safe use of AI and robotics
- AI-native learning (content + chatbot + personalization)
- Open-source first mindset

## Technical Stack Requirements:
- Book Framework: Docusaurus
- Content Generation: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus
- Chatbot: OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDK
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Vector Store: Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)
- Deployment: GitHub Pages or Vercel
