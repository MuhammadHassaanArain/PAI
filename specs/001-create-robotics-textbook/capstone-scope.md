# Capstone Project Scope: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The capstone project requires students to build a simulated autonomous humanoid robot that can perform the following tasks:

1.  **Navigation**: The robot must be able to navigate to a specified location in the Gazebo simulation environment.
2.  **Vision**: The robot must be able to detect and identify a specific object (e.g., a red cube) using its camera.
3.  **Manipulation**: The robot must be able to pick up the identified object.
4.  **Voice Command**: The robot must be able to accept a natural language command (e.g., "pick up the red cube") to initiate the task.

## Bonus Features

- **Advanced Manipulation**: Implement a more complex manipulation task, such as stacking blocks or placing the object in a specific location.
- **Advanced Vision**: Implement more advanced vision capabilities, such as object tracking or face recognition.
- **Advanced Navigation**: Implement more advanced navigation capabilities, such as dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- **Real-World Deployment**: Deploy the system on a physical robot (e.g., a Jetson-powered robot).
